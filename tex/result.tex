\subsection{Parameter Identification}
Fig. \ref{fig:length_pressure} displays the relationship between the pressure $p$ and the natural length $l_n$ of the PAMs. As assumed, there is a tendency for $l_n$ to decrease linearly with $p$ within the range of the tested pressure. The dashed lines in Fig. \ref{fig:length_pressure} represent the fitted lines using the least squares method, expressed by Eq. (\ref{eq:L_n}).
Fig. \ref{fig:pam_b_static1} shows the result of the static loading experiment for PAM-B. The red and blue points represent the data during expansion and contraction respectively, and the green dashed lines represent the solutions $d$ to Eq. (\ref{eq:model}), which is given by substituting the acquired parameters $a_i$ and the measured $f$ and $p$.
Generally, PAMs exhibit hysteresis due to friction, so the data differ between expansion and contraction processes. We only present the static loading experimental result for PAM-B because of the space constraint, but similar results were obtained for the other PAMs.

\subsection{Error Evaluation} 
Fig. \ref{fig:pam_b_dynamic} and Fig. \ref{fig:pam_d_dynamic} show the dynamic length estimation result for PAM-B and PAM-D, respectively.
With the proposed method, with respect to the measurements by the linear encoder, the length estimation was achieved with maximum errors of $1.72\%$ for PAM-A, $1.19\%$ for PAM-B, $1.18\%$ for PAM-B, and  $1.65\%$ for PAM-D respectively , and with root mean squared errors of $0.861\%$ for PAM-A, $0.653\%$ for PAM-B, $0.683\%$ for PAM-C, and $0.846\%$ for PAM-D respectively.

\subsection{Reaching Task}
Table. \ref{tab:PAM_reflex} shows the parameters for the length estimation of the agonist and antagonist muscles. The considerable difference in the voltage-force slope $q$ between the two PAMs is attributable to the varying sensitivities of the handmade strain gauges.

Fig.\ref{fig:reaching_error} displays the length estimation errors of the model and the fiber sensor in reaching task. Since the fiber sensor could only measure the rate of length change and not the absolute length, the estimated absolute length by the fiber sensor was calibrated to the measurement value from the linear encoder at the start of the reaching task. Therefore, it cannot be said that Fig.\ref{fig:reaching_error} is exactly comparing the estimates from the model and from the fiber sensor, but it serves as a reference for examining the accuracy of the model against the conventional sensor. The reaching task was performed five times for both the agonist and antagonist muscles. For the agonist muscle, with respect to the linear encoder measurement, the model showed a maximum error of $5.86\%$ and a root mean squared error of $3.17\%$, while the fiber sensor showed a maximum error of $2.53\%$ and a root mean squared error of $1.02\%$. For the antagonist muscle, the model showed a maximum error of $5.86\%$ and a root mean squared error of $5.02\%$, while the fiber sensor showed a maximum error of $2.53\%$ and a root mean squared error of $1.78\%$.

\subsection{Stretch Reflex}
Table \ref{tab:reflex_para} shows the velocity threshold $V_{thr}$ and the feedback gain $k$, and they were determined experimentally by assessing the magnitude of the impact. 

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \caption{Parameters for Stretch Reflex} 
    \begin{tabular}{c|cc}
        \hline
        PAM &$V_{thr} [\si{mm/s}]$&$ k [\si{GPa\cdot s}]$\\
        \hline \hline
        Model & 70 & 1/800\\
        Fiber Sensor & 25 & 1/300\\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
\label{tab:reflex_para}
\end{table}

Fig. \ref{fig:reflex_all} illustrates the dynamic behavior of the reflex by the model. The starting angle of the arm was -36 deg due to the basket's weight of 83.1 g. When the falling mass made an impact, the angle dropped dramatically, creating sudden soar in the voltage signal from the strain gauge and thus in the estimated velocity. It went beyond the threshold and triggered the stretch reflex, leading to increasing pressure in the agonist muscle and decreasing in antagonist. The arm was then lifted back to the initial position, and after some oscillation, it settled down to a certain angle, holding the mass left in the basket.


Fig.\ref{fig:reflex_angle} displays the average and range of angles in 20 trials of the reflexes by the model and by the fiber sensor. Since the thresholds and gains for each reflex are determined experimentally, it is not possible to purely compare the behavior of the arm angles, but it can be said that the reflex by the fiber sensor are well replicated by the model.
